# MobiSong (2003)

In 2003, the [“Mobile Spielaktion
Karlsruhe”](https://www.mobi-aktion.de) celebrated its 25th
anniversary.  Given the text and melody of a birthday song that the
members of this institution already had created, I was asked to write
and produce an orchestral arrangement of the song for them.  The
result can be heard
[here](https://soundcloud.com/soundpaint-1/mobisong).  You can view
the vocal part of the score [here](mobisong.pdf), including the German
lyrics.
