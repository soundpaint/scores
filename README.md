# scores

This repository contains an unsorted collection of scores of musical
works, stage plays and related work that, to my best knowledge, are

* either in the public domain or
* have been written by me from scratch, such that I am the sole
  copyright holder, or
* have been arranged or extended by me based on existing musical or
  other works that I believe to be in the public domain.

Some scores may be supplemented by additional material, such as stage
scripts that are also copyrighted by me, unless otherwise noted.

If you think I made a mistake in that some of the works in this
repository are copyrighted by a third party, please contact me
personally for clarification prior to suing me.
