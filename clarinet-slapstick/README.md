# Klarinetten-Slapstick (2001)

“Klarinetten-Slapstick” is the title of a stage play without words
that I conceived, wrote, rehearsed and performed for the University
choir's Christmas celebration in 2001. It is about two clarinet
players and performs in the setting of a restaurant or cafe. The two
main characters fail to fulfill their task of playing a clarinet duo
due to slapstick-like misfortune.

Here is the stage script (in German language) of the play:

The play starts with a piano piece that is closely connected with the
story of the play. The score is here:
