# Ding Dong Bells

Ding Dong Bells is a traditional old English tune that can be sung as
round for up to 4 voices.

Though I could not find out anything relevant about the history of
this work, from the melody I believe that the tune must have been
composed during the Victorian age.  For practical use, I have adapted
it to the key of G major, e.g. for use in a SATB mixed choir setting.
I think, the key of G major also perfectly matches the playful melody
phrases around the main major and minor triads, that slighty remind me
of a typical intrada style.
