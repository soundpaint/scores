This score is a written out version of the old traditional English
carol "We Wish You a Merry Christmas".  For more information about the
melody and text, see this [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Wish_You_a_Merry_Christmas).

This written out version was arranged by me and performed as a
Christmas Greetings jingle.  The perfomance was recorded on November
11, 2018, and is available on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxfChryaEjc).
